## Project Description

This project implements a simple slot machine game with a command-line interface. Players can deposit money, choose the number of lines to bet on, and spin the slot machine to see if they win. The game incorporates Python fundamentals and concepts, making it an excellent resource for learning Python programming.

## Techniques Used

- **Python Programming:** The entire project is implemented in Python, making use of its syntax, data structures, and standard libraries.

- **Random Module:** The `random` module is utilized to generate random outcomes for the slot machine spin.

- **Functions:** Functions are employed to modularize the code, making it more readable and maintainable.

- **User Input Handling:** The project demonstrates how to take user input, validate it, and provide appropriate feedback.

- **Dictionaries:** Python dictionaries are used to store information about symbol counts and values in the slot machine.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main Python script containing the slot machine game code.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project.
